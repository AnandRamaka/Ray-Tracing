# Ray Tracer in C++
## CS 128 Fall 2021 Final Project

Our project is a Raytracer written in modern C++. Our motivation for this project is to demonstrate our ability to integrate complex math while creating something that is visually appealing. We want to explore graphics, a topic that we are relatively unfamiliar with. Also, raytracers have numerous applications in game development, film, and other industries. This project would be a great intro into this industry.
